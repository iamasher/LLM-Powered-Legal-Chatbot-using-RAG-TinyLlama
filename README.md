# Fine-Tuned RAG Chatbot with Streaming Responses â€“ Amlgo Labs

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that allows users to ask questions about legal documents (like Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policies) and receive factual, grounded answers using an open-source LLM.

It integrates semantic search (via FAISS + MiniLM embeddings) and a lightweight local LLM (TinyLlama via Ollama) into a real-time, streaming chatbot interface built with Streamlit.
